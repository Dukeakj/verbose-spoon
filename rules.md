# X-Team 73 Rules

These rules establish how our team will assign tasks,
track progress on each task, and communicate with each other 
when a member is unable to complete a task that has been assigned to that member.

This document helps individual members understand the team's expectations,
and will hopefully lead to productive team work with fewer conflicts
and missed deadlines.

## How we will assign (and reassign) tasks



## How will we will track progress (and follow-up) on completion of tasks

We will make clear to the group what each person is working on, and that person will regularly push their changes to the group repository

## How will will communicate difficulties with a task assigned to us
We will use groupme to give a heads up to other members if there is an issue with a task, and if in person that member will communicate the problem to the group for everybody to solve.


## How we will back up each other to ensure that deadlines are not missed



## Add any other rules that your team establishes to help each other work effectively together
